# AGEP-Commits
Ario committing style for git repositories.

Here is AGEP-Commits 1:

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">Basics</h2>

Every commits should have 3 parts:

1. At a Glance Emoji
2. Subject Line
3. Body

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">At a Glance Emoji</h2>

Emojis are used to make a useful brief glance at commits.
Here is a list of Ario's standard and valid emojis with the case of using them:

- 🐞 : Fix a bug
- 🚀 : Make a release
- 🧾 : Add, edit or modify general scripts
- 🎨 : Add, edit or modify style or appearance
- 🔑 : Add, edit or modify a security or authentication feature
- 🤖 : Add, edit or modify a model engine
- 📮 : Add, edit or modify a database
- 📚 : Add, edit or modify documents

Remember to use these emojis for every commit, they are very very helpful.

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">Subject Line</h2>

- The subject line should summarize the changes made in the commit
- Use a clear and descriptive 
- Should be no longer than <u>65 characters</u> 
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line: The subject line     should describe what the commit does, rather than what was done. For example, use "**Fix bug in login form**" instead of "**Fixed a bug in the login form.**"

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">Body</h2>
