Ario committing style for git repositories.

Here is AGEP-Commits 1:

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">Basics</h2>

Every commits should have 3 parts:

1. At a Glance Emoji
2. Subject Line
3. Body

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">At a Glance Emoji</h2>

Emojis are used to make a useful brief glance at commits.
Here is a list of Ario's standard and valid emojis with the case of using them:

- 🐞 : Fix a bug
- 🚀 : Make a release
- 🧾 : Add, edit or modify general scripts
- 🎨 : Add, edit or modify style or appearance
- 🔑 : Add, edit or modify a security or authentication feature
- 🤖 : Add, edit or modify a model engine
- 📮 : Add, edit or modify a database
- 📚 : Add, edit or modify documents
- 📦 : Update repo from other source
- 🔙 : Backward to the older commits

Remember to use these emojis for every commit, they are very very helpful.

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">Subject Line</h2>

The subject line should summarize the changes made in the commit

- Use a clear and descriptive.
- Should be no longer than <u>65 characters</u>.
- Use the imperative mood in the subject line: The subject line     should describe what the commit does, rather than what was done. For example, use "**Fix bug in login form**" instead of "**Fixed a bug in the login form.**"
- Use capital type for main words in subject line.

<h2 style="color:rgba(50,84,108,255)">Body</h2>

Body is to provide more detail. 

The body of the commit message should provide more detail about the changes made in the commit. It should include information about the motivation for the change, the approach taken, and any other relevant details.

If the commit includes multiple changes, <u>use bullet points</u> to list them. This can help make the commit message easier to read and understand.

There is no limitation for the lengths of body, Explain as much as you need about the details of the commit to clarify the changes.
